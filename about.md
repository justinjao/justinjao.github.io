Hey! I'm Justin. Welcome to my blog!

As you might have guessed, my name's sort of where the title of my blog comes from.

_I know_, it's a bit derivative, and a bit of a lame play on words. But I often find myself lost in thought, so I figured it was pretty apt.

Previously, I graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC) with a degree in Behavioural Neuroscience. While I was studying life science, I had the opportunity
to try out various research positions, and was lucky enough to get to work on some projects that exposed me to programmatic data analysis (primarily with R). As I learned more about the world of data science and how incredibly exciting and innovative coding could be, I realized I was interested in exploring
programming at a deeper level, and I wanted a more fundamental understanding of the tools and technologies I was using.

I'm now currently studying Computer Science as an undergraduate student in the BCS program at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

Here, I plan to chronicle my thoughts, experiences, and things I learn as I progress further into the world of technology (and probably some ramblings about life in general and whatever else I feel like writing down in the moment).
